# PSD to HTML CONVERT RESOURCE

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects contained in the course.

Plus, I made all the course slides available for download, to make it easier to follow along the conceptual videos.

?? ***Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course*** ??

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the complete package, hit the green button saying "Clone or download", choose the "Download ZIP" option, and you're good to go.

### Q2: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?
